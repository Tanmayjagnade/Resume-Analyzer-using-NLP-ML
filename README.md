 # Resume Analyzer using NLP and ML

## Overview
Developed and deployed a robust Resume Analyzer to streamline candidate screening, reducing manual effort by [X]%. Utilized Python, spaCy, NLTK, pdfminer, and Streamlit to design and implement algorithms for extracting relevant information from resumes.


## Components

- *Web Application*: Built using Streamlit for easy interaction via a web interface.
- *Text Extraction*: Utilizes pdfminer to extract text from PDF files.
- *Text Preprocessing*: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization using spaCy and NLTK.
- *Similarity Calculation*: Cosine similarity calculation using TF-IDF vectorization.
